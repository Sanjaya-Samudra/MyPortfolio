          <p>
            Welcome to my digital space! I’m a full-stack developer with a love for building sleek, responsive, and scalable applications. Code is my playground, and I thrive on transforming complex challenges into elegant solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            I specialize in <span class="highlight">Angular</span>, crafting smooth user experiences and creating dynamic interfaces. But that’s just the beginning – I also dabble in backend technologies, UI/UX design, and everything in between.
          </p>
          <p>
            My journey started with a curiosity about how things work, and that curiosity has evolved into a career where I get to build products that empower users and solve real-world problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I’m not writing code, you’ll find me <span class="highlight">exploring new technologies</span>, <span class="highlight">learning about design principles</span>, or indulging in my love for <span class="highlight">photography and gaming</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe in the power of collaboration and constantly strive to learn from others while contributing to open-source projects, sharing knowledge, and embracing new ideas. Every day is an opportunity to improve, to innovate, and to create something extraordinary.
